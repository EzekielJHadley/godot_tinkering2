for station ideas

each station will generate "units" per second
with a max number of units
these both can be upgraded by spending units

clicking on the station will start the connection between it and another station
drad and collide with another staion to set the connection
click on the connector again to disconnect it
each station will send out a signal that it will start to transfer to the connected node
if both nodes try to connect to eachother the connector will manage the "contest"
to detect if there is already a connector there, check all the existing ones
	there will only be 10's of them and not 1,000's of them

Contested connectors
	it will acrue units from one of the stations and wait until the other station sends units
	the difference goes to the losing station
	visually the connector will be gray until the first station sends in units, then i will show it is half filled
	if the first station fires off again then it will show 3/4's filled (etc)
	once the contest is over the connection will turn the station's team color and a light will travel twords the loser
		so if station A sends 5 units ever 1 second and goes first the connector will wait for station B
		when station B sends 4 units after its 1 second delay 
		the connecto will determine station B lost and transfers 1 unit to station B
		
		if station A sends 3 units every 1/2 second
		and station B sends 7 units every 1 second
		then the connector will contain 6 A units after 1 second, and 7 B units
		resulting in B winning the contest and sending 1 units to A
	
	(we could also make the connector always display the last contest winner:
		have it be 3/4s the winner color and fade into the losers color)
		
(we could also skip the whole contest idea and just have it transfer units both ways, but this might be more visually interesting)
a the benefit of teh contest is that it visiually shows who is sending more units over all
